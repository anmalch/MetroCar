# MetroCar
The Project focuses on analyzing the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app similar to Uber or Lyft. This project will help identify potential areas for improvement and optimization. By utilizing SQL for data collection and Pandas for data analysis and visualization, we will answer several critical business questions posed by stakeholders.


## 🚗 About Metrocar
Metrocar is a ride-sharing app that connects riders with drivers via a mobile platform. The service operates similarly to other ride-hailing platforms, with a focus on user convenience and efficient ride-hailing processes.

### Metrocar’s Customer Funnel
The funnel typically includes the following stages:

1. **App Download** – User downloads the Metrocar app.
2. **Signup** – User creates an account by providing name, email, phone number, and payment info.
3. **Request Ride** – User requests a ride by entering location and destination.
4. **Driver Acceptance** – A driver accepts the ride request.
5. **Ride** – The driver picks up and transports the rider to their destination.
6. **Payment** – User is charged automatically after the ride.
7. **Review** – User rates their experience and provides feedback.

At each stage, users may drop off, and the funnel analysis will identify where and why drop-offs occur.
